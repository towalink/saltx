## Installation

Install as root user using PyPi:

```shell
pip3 install saltx
```

Note that this no longer works in more recent environments as `pip3` should no longer install in the system environment. You may do

```shell
pip3 install saltx --break-system-packages
```

to override. Alternatively use `pipx` (install via `apt install pipx` on Debian) like this:

```shell
PIPX_HOME=/opt/pipx PIPX_BIN_DIR=/usr/bin pipx install saltx
```

You may use another directory than `/opt/pipx` but it must be accessible for the user that will run `saltx` later (i.e. don't use the default directory located within the root home directory if you also want to run as non-root user). `PIPX_BIN_DIR` needs to be in the system search path (`systemd-path search-binaries-default` on Debian).
